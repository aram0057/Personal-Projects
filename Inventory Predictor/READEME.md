Version 1.0

Project Overview
The Inventory Predictor is an AI-based machine learning model designed to assist businesses in predicting inventory requirements by analyzing past stock data. This tool helps optimize stock management by forecasting future inventory needs, reducing overstocking, and avoiding stockouts.

The model is built using Jupyter Notebooks and Flask, and leverages machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions based on historical data from a CSV file.
